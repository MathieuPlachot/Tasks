# Intro

Simple and Lightweight Task application with Pomodoro Timer:

Main targets/features (in progress):
- No need to create any account
- Portable / No Install
- Focus time tracking
- Activity Log
- Integration with (local) Outlook

With a python environment: launch Pomo.py to start the application.
Without python environment: I will soon release a standalone windows executable

- Handle several profiles/databases (Personal/Professional ...)

# Known Issues

To be scheduled:
- Edition of tasks is not always refreshed / taken into account
- Logged incrementation continues after the timer reaches 0 if the STOP button is not pressed
